# Boss Chase Senior Game Design Expo Build
The build of my side project Boss Chase displayed at my college's Senior Game Design Expo

----------------------------------------------------------------

**Intended Game Platform:** PC/Console

**Target Age of Players:** 15+

**Intended ESRB Rating:** T (For Mild Violence)

**Game Summary:** The Void, an ever-changing dimension, traps all that come in contact with it and you are no exception. Playing as one of eight Roles, or creating one of your own, you must chase down the Void’s Elite to recover your most valuable possession. Boss Chase is a 2D Side-scrolling Game that mixes the two popular gameplay genres of Endless Runner and Boss Rush in a fast paced, high adrenaline game where quick reaction and determination rule.

**Unique Selling Points:**
* Never stop fighting! Melding together two high action genres, Boss Chase forces players to react fast as they run through the Void fighting boss after boss.
* Customize your play style! While there are eight Roles the player can choose from, each building from four base classes, players can create their own Role as a powerful hero or a weak peasant without worry of being locked out of any gameplay.
* Never fight alone! Boss Chase allows for two players to join together to fight the Void’s elite in Local Multiplayer Mode.

**Competitive Products:** *Run or Die, Cuphead, Super Meat Boy*
